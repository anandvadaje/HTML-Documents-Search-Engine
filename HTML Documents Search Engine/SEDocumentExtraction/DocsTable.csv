50,IN SANTIAGO NEWS OF PINOCHET'S ARREST STIRS ONLY SMALL PROTEST,794,SANTIAGO Chile _ Perhaps as a sign of how much Chileans wish toforget their years of polarized politics and repression under Gen.Augusto Pinochet the immediate popular response here to thesensational news of his arrest in London has been remarkable forits moderation. About 200 supporters of the retired dictator gathered at theresidence of the British ambassador on Saturday evening to protestthe arrest some throwing fruit and eggs at the building. Some demonstrators burned a British flag in front of the nearbyresidence of the Spanish ambassador before the police arrived in atruck with water cannon at which point the protesters obedientlywithdrew. Chilean television news repeatedly showed the same videotape ofa leftist counterdemonstrator in heated discussions with theprotesting Pinochet supporters before he was arrested and carriedkicking and screaming into a police van. But in a display of uncensored political debate that would havebeen unthinkable only a decade ago under the general's ruletelevision broadcasts also showed myriad reactions to the arrestfrom political figures ranging from Communist Party leaders torightist retired generals. Many Chileans still harbor bitter memories of Pinochet'sdictatorial ways including the deaths and disappearances of morethan 3000 people in the 17 years that followed his violentoverthrow of the elected Socialist government of President SalvadorAllende in 1973. But most political analysts say a large majority wants to putthe era of radical politics and repression behind it a trendequally apparent in neighboring Argentina and Brazil which alsowent through periods of rule by military juntas. President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in Portugal for a summitmeeting of Iberian and Latin American leaders charged that Britainwas breaking international law saying that Pinochet now anunelected senator for life carried a diplomatic passport givinghim legal immunity. Frei leads a governing coalition that includes ChristianDemocrats and Socialists and his strong defense of the general'srights was only one of a string of similar comments from civilianpoliticians who have spent most of their political careers opposingPinochet.
